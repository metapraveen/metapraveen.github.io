For long time my daily work was not organised, and I saw some recurrent problems with that.

1. I easily forgot what I did few days back.
2. Though I learnt things I did not internalise them well so I could share or talk about it with rest of the team
3. Did not have list of things to improve in the product for long term though I came across pain points
4. Often did not have topics for my bi weekly 1 to 1
5. Did not have points to add in bi-monthly retro (though I saw few pain points these are not written down in structured way)

To fix this I now organise my work by writing small notes and taking some time out after each chunk of work to write something down about it.

So there is log of my daily deep work sessions also I write notes on them before ending my work day. This helps to disconnect from work and start next day from the state I left.

I keep a log of my learnings on tech/domain/process etc, and try to formulate it well so I can share them with the team in our weekly team sync ( we dont have daily standup, we meet once a week to share our learnings)

If I get frustrated with something I write it down and possible solution for it, this I take it my bi-weekly 1 to 1 with my manager. This has lead to good outcome of solving some pain points.

Also this helped me to build my own brag doc of my achivements.

As keeping multiple notes across feels hard so I built a web application to handle this. I will soon publish it so anyone else also struggling with organizing their work can give a try.
